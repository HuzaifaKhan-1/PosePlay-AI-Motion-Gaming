# PosePlay-AI-Motion-Gaming
Experience hands-free gaming with real-time pose detection! This project lets you play Temple Run using body movements—move, jump, and slide without a controller. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, it redefines interactive gameplay and explores new possibilities in accessibility and AR integration. 🚀🎮

Pose Detection Game Using OpenCV & MediaPipe 🎮🕺

🚀 Introducing a Hands-Free Gaming Experience! 🚀

This project brings an innovative way to play Temple Run—using only your body movements! By leveraging real-time pose detection, it eliminates the need for traditional controllers, making gaming more interactive and immersive.

🎮 How It Works

🔹 Move left → Shift your body left🔹 Move right → Shift your body right🔹 Jump → Move forward/upward🔹 Slide → Lower your body

Using computer vision, this project opens new possibilities in accessibility, fitness, and virtual interactions.
